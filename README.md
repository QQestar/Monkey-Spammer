## How It Was Made

Monkey Spammer was developed using Python as the primary programming language. The program leverages:

- **PyAutoGUI:** For automating keyboard input and simulating mouse clicks.
- **customtkinter:** To create a modern, visually appealing graphical user interface (GUI) that lets users enter messages, set repetition multipliers, and specify delays.
- **Time Module:** For controlling the delay between messages.
  
The program was first developed and tested as a Python script in an IDE (PyCharm), and then converted into a standalone executable using PyInstaller. This ensures that the final product is easy to run on any Windows machine without requiring Python to be installed.
